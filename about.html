                                    Born and bread in the year 1991, in Accra Ghana, I was born into a family of six.
                                    My dream was to become an auto-technician because I saw my father do it and I loved
                                    it. In fact I love automobiles even till now.
                                    Growing up, I realized I could make poeple laugh so I ventured into theatre and had
                                    my first degree in it.
                                    Through my theatre studies, I unearthed my communication talent and pusued it.
                                    Thus, I trained for radio and worked with the University of Ghana's campus radio
                                    station for almost two years.
                                    After my first degree, I became a teaching assistant and still worked at the
                                    aforementioned radio station for a year concurrently.
                                    In pursuit for higher grounds in my field, I studied for my Masters in Communication
                                    studies at Universitas Diponegoro, Indonesia.
                                    Studying in a totally different culture broadened my scope of thinking. It made me
                                    realize how diverse the world is and how diverse humans can become too.
                                    With this broader perspective, I decided to venture into several other disciplines
                                    outside my scope.
                                    I tried with leadership and became the leader for the international students in the
                                    country.
                                    In my own small world, I tried to be a home barber and I was successful in styling
                                    the hair of my student friends.
                                    I also tried in soccer I became the captain of my school team.
                                    And now I am trying my hands on computer programming with Code Institute, Ireland.
                                    I therefore understand that, there is nothing we as humans cannot do.
                                    It all starts from trying and the word again is trying.
                                    This is where I developed the mentality of the lion. He is not the smartest, fastest
                                    nor the biggest in the jungle but he makes up his mind and goes for the catch. He
                                    tries and he succeeeds, he does it over and over again. Then he comes to believe in himself
                                    as the king. In so doing, every other being believes that he is indeed the king.
